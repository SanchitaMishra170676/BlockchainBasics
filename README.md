# BlockchainBasics
Contains the assignment to the Blockchain Basics course offered by Buffalo University on Coursera.
Core topics :
# Blockhain - for decentralised, peer to peer connection
## Developing Trust:
* Validation
* Verification
* Consensus Protocol
* Immutable Recording
#### use of immutable distributed ledger
## Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO)
* Unique Identifier
* index
* amt
* optional : condition
## Transaction (Tx) 
* Refernce no. to the current transaction
* Reference to one or more input UTXOs
* Reference to one or more output UTXOs  (newly generated by the current transaction)
* Total input and output
## Genesis Block (Block0) : 
### The zeroth or first block of the block chain  
## Summary
* No. of transactions
* Output total
* Estimated Transaction
* Transaction fees
* Height
* Time stamp
* Received Time
* Relayed by
* Difficulty
* Bits
* Size
* Weight
* Version
* Nonce
* Block Reward
## Hash
* Previous Block
* Next Block
* Merkle Root
## Work of miners
* verify transactions
* Broadcast transactions
* compete to create a block
* Reacg consensus by validating blocks
* Broadcast new bolck
* confirm transactions
#### Miners perform operations designed by bolckchain proetocal

## Transaction 0
* for paying minor fees
* does not have an input UTXO
* is called coin based transaction

## Smart Contract
#### Etherium bolckchain used the optional scripting feature to develop a full blown code execution framework called smart contract
Execution of smart contract is initiated by a message embedded in the tracnsaction

## Types of Blockchain
* only cryptocurrency - Bitcoin
* currency + Bussiness logic - Etherium
* Only Bussiness logic - Linux foundation's Hyperledger

## Categories:
* Public
* Private
* Permissioned / consortium

### Solidity for Smart Contract
#### Basic Syntax
pragma solidity ^0.40;
contract SimpleStorage {
 uint storedData;
 function set (uint x){
  storedData =x;
  }
  
  function get() constant returns (uint){
  return storedData;
  }
  }
  
  The code is rum in EVM or etherium virtual machine
  
  #### Reference no.
  input UTXOs --> output UTXOs
  
 ## TYpes of Accounts
 * Externaly owned acc
 * Contract Acc
 
 ### Externally owned acc can transfer ethers or messages
 ### Contract accs are used to hold ethres while acting as an intermediary. 
 Eg - Caution machine will be stored in the contract acc and transferred in the respective acc as per the situations and norms.
